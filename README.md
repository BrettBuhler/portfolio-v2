## Improvement Over the First Portfolio

If you want to take a look at my first portfolio site, you can find it at https://brettbuhler.github.io/portfolio/. Comparing it with Portfolio-v2, you'll notice significant improvements in terms of design, functionality, and overall user experience. I've incorporated the dynamic list design pattern in this version to accommodate a growing tech stack and an expanding list of projects without any layout issues.

## Hosting and CI/CD Pipeline

Portfolio-v2 is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and utilizes Cloud Build for a robust continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This allows for efficient development and deployment workflows, ensuring that updates to the portfolio site are automatically built and deployed to the hosting environment.
